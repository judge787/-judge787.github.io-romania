            <h1>A Brief History on Romania</h1>
            <p>The Romanian people virtually vanished from documented history between the entrance of the Huns in the 5th century and the formation of the princes of Walachia and Moldavia in the 14th century. During this time, Romania was invaded by massive people migrations and horse-mounted troops across the Danubian Plain. Romanians are thought to have been compelled to relocate due to constant bloodshed, seeking refuge in the Carpathian Mountains. "Resistance having practically always proven ineffective, the Romanians could no longer think of any other form of protection except flight," military chief Helmuth von Moltke observed. The Romanian lands were used as battlegrounds for their neighbours' competing ambitions over the following 600 years. The Romanians were unable to overcome imperial pressures from the Byzantines and afterwards the Ottoman Turks in Constantinople (now Istanbul), as well as imperial influences from the Habsburg empire to the west and Russia to the east. The prinipalities of Walachia and Moldavia were merged in 1859, and the contemporary Romania declared independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877. This was accompanied by a change from the Cyrillic to the Latin alphabet, as well as an exodus of students seeking higher education in western Europe, particularly France. </p>

    <h1>More Information</h1>
    <p>Romanians consider themselves to be descended from the Dacians who resided in the highlands north of the Danubian Plain and in the Transylvanian Basin, as well as the ancient Romans who conquered southern Transylvania under Emperor Trajan in 105 CE.</p>
    <p>The Roman settlers and the Dacians had intermarried by the time of Emperor Aurelian's withdrawal in 271, resulting in the formation of a new nation.​</p>
    <p>The Romanian language's Latin roots, as well as the Eastern Orthodox faith that most Romanians follow, arose from the blending of these two cultures.​</p>
    <p>The Romanian Revolution was a period of violent civil unrest in Romania during December 1989 as a part of the Revolutions of 1989 that occurred in several countries around the world.</p>
