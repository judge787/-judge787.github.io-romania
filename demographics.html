            <h1>Romania's Demographics</h1>
        <p>Romania had a population of only 3.6 million people in 1844. Romania's borders were quite different and much smaller during the early entries in this data, as control of this area frequently exchanged hands between the Austrian, Ottoman, and Russian empires. The population estimates for this period are based on incomplete census data, and they show that the population doubled from 3.6 million in 1844 to 7.2 million in 1912. Part of this growth is due to a high natural birth rate, but it is also due to the changing of Romania's borders and annexation of new lands. During this time, the Russo-Turkish War in 1878 resulted in Romania's independence from the Ottoman Empire showcasing an experienced period of increased stability and progress.  Romania's population peaked at 24.49 million people in 1990, the most it has ever been. Romania's population has fallen since then, with a projected population of 19.24 million in 2020. Romania's population is expected to continue to fall, reaching 11.88 million by the end of the century. Romania's current population growth rate is -0.66%, implying a population loss of about 126,866 persons between 2019 and 2020. This is due to a combination of negative net migration and a lower-than-replacement-rate fertility rate of 1.62 births per woman. Over 3.5 million Romanians left the nation between 2007 and 2015 to escape poverty and corruption. Many of those exiting Romania are professionals with advanced degrees looking for new opportunities. This has a significant influence on Romania's already troubled economy.</p>
